        Upon creating the campaign, you will be redirected to the
        Campaign Builder UI. In the <strong>Builder</strong> tab,
        you should see two variants by default (v1 and v2), and a
        list of input elements, which come from your application
        settings JSON.

        by clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the top
